This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through an array. The bug.java file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.java provides the corrected version.  The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= arr.length` attempts to access an index beyond the valid range of the array. Arrays in Java are zero-indexed, so the last valid index is `arr.length - 1`.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate through the array using `i < arr.length`.
